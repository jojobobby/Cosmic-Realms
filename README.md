Known Issues (I don't feel like looking into & you should if you want to use this source.)
--------

-Fps drops. //"attemptAttackAngle" in [MapUserInput.as]

-Moon Closing feature is not finished, should be removed unless you'll be building upon it. [Moon.cs]

-Tq command has some issues when being used in realm. [RankedCommands.cs]

-Chat size is set to 0 by default so you cannot see chat. - I should have fixed this but i cannot test.
