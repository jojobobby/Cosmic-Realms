Known Issues (I don't feel like looking into & you should if you want to use this source.)
--------

-Conditional Effects do not display their condition above player head, instead only shows icon. //"Damage" GameObject.as

-Fps drops. //"attemptAttackAngle" in MapUserInput.as

-Moon Closing feature is not finished, should be removed unless you'll be building upon it. //Moon.cs

-Tq command has some issues when being used in realm. //RankedCommands.cs "Tq"

-Chat scaling is set to 0 by default. - I should have fixed this but i cannot test.
